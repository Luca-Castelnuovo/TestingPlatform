        <h2>Genius, billionair, playboy, philanthropist</h2>
        <p><i>Anthony Edward Stark</i>, later known as Tony, was born on the 29th of may 1970. When he was only 21 years old, he inherited his fathers, who was assasinated by The winter soldier, missile company. This was know as "Stark Industries". When he was out in the Middle-East, to demonstrate one of his latest missiles, he got hit by one of them and kidnapped by terrorists, known as the ten rings. Their leader, the Mandarin, forced him to make missiles, or he would get killed. But after the explosion his heart was severly damaged, so he was forced to place a magnetic plate, his first Arc rector, on his chest to prevent the metals of reaching his heart. But instead of building missiles like demanded, Tony made his first Iron Man armour, the mark 1. After beating up the terrorists, he flew away to his freedom.</p>
        <p>After this experience, he dedicated his life to become the Invincible Iron Man. He made alot, and I mean hundreds of other suits and defended the world several times.</p>
